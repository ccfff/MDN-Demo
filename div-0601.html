     <h1>My use of language and my cats</h1>
     <p>My cat's behavior hasn't changed much since her absence, except
     that she plays her new physique to the neighbors regularly, in an
     attempt to get pets.</p>

       <p>My other cat, coloured black and white, is a sweetie. He followed
       us to the pool today, walking down the pavement with us. Yesterday
